# CareSupport OS
**Desktop Command Center for Personal Care Coordination**

## Overview
CareSupport OS is a desktop-first platform that transforms complex personal care coordination into a manageable system. Built for care coordinators like Rob who manage large care teams, it provides enterprise-grade scheduling, coverage intelligence, and team management tools.

## Core Concept
Every complex care situation is essentially a micro home care agency. CareSupport OS gives individual coordinators the same sophisticated tools that agencies use, but focused on managing one care recipient with their extended care team.

## Key Features
- **Command Center Dashboard**: Real-time coverage status and team overview
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Shift-based coordination with gap detection
- **Coverage Intelligence**: Automated alerts and backup coordination  
- **Team Management**: Track 20+ caregivers, family, and backup support
- **Accessibility First**: Built for mouth stick operation and voice control

## Architecture
- **CareSupport OS** (Desktop): Full coordination command center
- **CareSupport Remote** (Mobile): Companion app for caregivers in the field
- **Real-time Sync**: Instant updates across all devices

## Target Users
- **Primary**: Care coordinators managing complex personal care (Rob, Marta)
- **Secondary**: Professional caregivers with multiple clients
- **Extended**: Family members and backup support network

## Technology Stack

## Vision
"Rob at his desktop with CareSupport OS, managing his 24-person care team effortlessly, while Jennifer on her phone with CareSupport Remote checks in for her overnight shift - both looking at the same system from different angles."
